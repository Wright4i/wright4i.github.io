# Joseph Wright's Programming Portfolio

Welcome to my personal programming portfolio on GitHub Pages. This site showcases a curated collection of my open source projects, insightful code tutorials, and a wealth of resources and experiences as an Independent Consultant Programmer specialized in the IBM i platform.

## About the Portfolio

This portfolio is more than just a compilation of projects; it's a reflection of my journey as a programmer with a particular focus on the robust IBM i and its integral language, RPG. While RPG remains at the heart of my expertise, this portfolio will guide you through my explorations and mastery of other technologies — Node.js, Python, and more! — as I integrate them with the traditional power of IBM i.

### What You'll Find Here

- **Open Source Projects:** Browse through various projects that I've made open for collaboration, each accompanied by documentation and insights into how they enhance IBM i applications.
- **Code Tutorials:** Dive into step-by-step tutorials that cover the gamut from the basics of Python to the nuances of integrating modern open-source technologies with IBM i systems.
- **RPG Corner:** A special section dedicated to RPG programming where you can find best practices, code snippets, and my personal commentary on the evolution of RPG over the years.
- **Tech Insights:** Articles and blog posts where I share my thoughts and experiences on the latest tech trends, how they impact the world of IBM i, and how to leverage them in your own development journey.

## Purpose

The aim of this GitHub Page is not only to display my work but also to contribute to the community of IBM i developers who are looking to expand their skillset with modern programming languages and tools. Whether you're an RPG veteran or a newcomer to the platform, my hope is that you'll find this resource both educational and inspiring.
