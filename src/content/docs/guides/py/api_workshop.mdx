## RESTful API Basics
REST (Representational State Transfer) is a way to design networked applications. It uses HTTP requests to perform operations like Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) on resources identified by URLs.

Key principles of REST:
- **Stateless**: Each request from client to server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.
- **Client-Server**: The client and server are independent and can be developed separately.
- **Cacheable**: Responses must define themselves as cacheable or not to prevent clients from reusing stale or inappropriate data.
- **Uniform Interface**: Resources are identified in the request, and the operations are defined by HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).

In summary, RESTful APIs provide a standardized way for systems to communicate over HTTP using a set of well-defined operations and principles.

### Methods
<CardGrid>
<Card title="GET" icon="list-format">
The GET method retrieves data from the server.
</Card>
<Card title="PUT" icon="add-document">
The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
</Card>
<Card title="PATCH" icon="pen">
The PATCH method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.
</Card>
<Card title="POST" icon="document">
The POST method is used update an existing resource or create a new resource.
</Card>
<Card title="DELETE" icon="bitbucket">
The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.
</Card>
<Card title="HEAD/OPTIONS/TRACE/CONNECT" icon="puzzle">
Less commonly used methods for various purposes like checking the server status, options available, tracing the request, and establishing a tunnel.
</Card>
</CardGrid>

### Status Codes
<CardGrid>
<Card title="200 OK" icon="approve-check">
The request has succeeded.
</Card>
<Card title="201 Created" icon="approve-check">
The request has been fulfilled and has resulted in one or more new resources being created.
</Card>
<Card title="400 Bad Request" icon="close">
The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client close.
</Card>
<Card title="401 Unauthorized" icon="close">
Similar to 403 Forbidden, but specifically for use when authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided.
</Card>
<Card title="404 Not Found" icon="close">
The requested resource could not be found but may be available in the future.
</Card>
<Card title="500 Internal Server Error" icon="error">
A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific message is suitable.
</Card>
</CardGrid>

## APIs Visualized
Swagger UI is a popular tool for visualizing APIs. It provides a user-friendly interface to interact with APIs and understand their endpoints and data structures.

If an API has an OpenAPI formatted yml or json file, you can use Swagger UI to visualize it.

<Aside type="note">
In this guide, we use `python3` and `pip3` commands. Depending on your system configuration, `python` might refer to Python 2. If that's the case, you need to use `python3` and `pip3` instead.
You can get more specific by using `python3.6` or `python3.9` if you have multiple versions installed.
</Aside>

### Project Setup
<CardGrid stagger>
<Card title="Step #1" icon="add-document">
Create a new folder for your project.
</Card>

<Card title="Step #2" icon="open-book">
Open Visual Studio Code and select "Open Folder" to open your project folder.
</Card>

<Card title="Step #3" icon="forward-slash">
Open the terminal (`` Ctrl + ` `` in VS Code).
</Card>

<Card title="Step #4" icon="laptop">
Create a new virtual environment: 
```shell
python3 -m venv --system-site-packages venv
```
<Aside type="note">
Virtual environments are used to manage dependencies for your projects.
</Aside>
</Card>

<Card title="Step #5" icon="rocket">
Activate your virtual environment:
    - On PASE (IBM i):
        ```shell
        . venv/bin/activate
        ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
        ```shell
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    - On Windows:
        ```shell
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
</Card>
</CardGrid>

## Setting up a Basic Flask Application

<Card>
### Step 1: Use the python package manager `pip` to install Flask
```shell
pip3 install flask
```
</Card>

<Card>
### Step 2: Create a new file `hello.py`
```python
// hello.py

from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, port=5000)
```

We start by importing the Flask module and creating a new instance of the Flask class. We then define a route for the root URL `/` that returns the string "Hello, World!".

<Aside type="note">
```python 
if __name__ == '__main__':
```
This construct is a common Python idiom that allows you to control the execution of code based on whether the script is run directly or imported as a module. 
</Aside>
</Card>

<Card>
### Step 2: Run your Flask app
```shell
python3 hello.py
```
</Card>

<Card>
### Step 3: Open your browser
Navigate to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see "Hello, World!".

<Aside type="tip">
GET endpoints can be tested directly in your browser! 
For other methods like POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE, you can use tools like Thunder Client or Postman.
</Aside>
</Card>

## Setting up the Database Connection

<Card>
### Step 1: Install additional packages
```shell
pip3 install python-dotenv pyodbc
```
</Card>

<Card>
### Step 2: Create a new file `.env`
```shell
// .env

PORT=5000
DB_HOST=hostname
DB_ID=your_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=SAMPLE
```
</Card>

<Card>
### Step 3: Copy this to a new file `db.py` 
<Aside type="tip">
Hover over the top-right corner of code blocks for a clipboard button <Icon name="right-arrow" class="icon-inline color-amethyst-high" />
</Aside>
```python
// db.py

import os
import pyodbc
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

class Database:
    def __init__(self):
        self.user = os.getenv('DB_ID')
        self.password = os.getenv('DB_PASSWORD')
        self.database = os.getenv('DB_NAME')

    def __enter__(self):
        self.conn = pyodbc.connect(
            f"DRIVER={{IBM i Access ODBC Driver}};SYSTEM={os.getenv('DB_HOST')};"
            f"UID={os.getenv('DB_ID')};PWD={os.getenv('DB_PASSWORD')}"
        )
        self.cursor = self.conn.cursor()
        return self.cursor

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        self.cursor.close()
        self.conn.close()

def get_db():
    return Database()
```
</Card>

## Creating API Endpoints

<Card>
### GET /employees
Create a new program `host.py`

Here's an example of a simple API that returns a list of employees from the `SAMPLE.EMPLOYEE` table:

```python
// host.py

from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
from db import get_db

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/employees', methods=['GET'])
def get_employees():
    conn = get_db()
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("""
        select 
            empno as "id",
            firstnme as "first",
            lastname as "last",
            job as "job",
            workdept as "workdept",
            salary as "salary"
        from sample.employee
    """)
    rows = cursor.fetchall()

    employee_list = []
    for row in rows:
        employee_list.append(row)
    
    return jsonify(employee_list)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, port=int(os.getenv('PORT')))
```
</Card>

<Card>
### GET /employees/`{id}`
Add the following route to `host.py` to retrieve a specific employee by their ID:
```python
// host.py

@app.route('/employees/<id>', methods=['GET'])
def get_employee(id):
    conn = get_db()
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("""
        select 
            empno as "id",
            firstnme as "first",
            lastname as "last",
            job as "job",
            workdept as "workdept",
            salary as "salary"
        from sample.employee
        where empno = ?
    """, (id,))
    employee = cursor.fetchone()

    if employee:
        employee_dict = {
            "id": employee[0],
            "first": employee[1],
            "last": employee[2],
            "job": employee[3],
            "workdept": employee[4],
            "salary": employee[5]
        }
        return jsonify(employee_dict)
    else:
        return jsonify({"error": "Employee not found"}), 404
```
</Card>

<Card>
### GET /departments/`{id}`
Add the following route to `host.py` to retrieve a specific department by its ID:
```python
// host.py

@app.route('/departments/<id>', methods=['GET'])
def get_department(id):
    conn = get_db()
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("""
        select 
            deptno as "id",
            deptname as "name",
            location as "location",
            mgrno as "manager"
        from sample.department
        where deptno = ?
    """, (id,))
    department = cursor.fetchone()

    if department:
        department_dict = {
            "id": department[0],
            "name": department[1],
            "location": department[2],
            "mgrno": department[3]
        }
        return jsonify(department_dict)
    else:
        return jsonify({"error": "Department not found"}), 404
```
</Card>

## Testing your API
Before we move onto other REST methods, let's cover how to test your API with tools that are available to you.

<CardGrid>
<Card>
### Thunder Client
Use the extension in VS Code to test your API endpoints. 
* Create a `New Request` and 
* Specify the Method (GET/PUT/PATCH) and URL (ex. `http://localhost:5000/employees`)
* Add any headers or body data.
* Click `Send Request` to see the response.

        </div>
    </a>
</div>
</Card>
</CardGrid>

<Card>
### PATCH /departments/`{id}`
Add the following route to `host.py` to update the manager for a specific department by its ID using a PATCH request:
```python
// host.py

@app.route('/departments/<id>', methods=['PATCH'])
def update_department(id):
    data = request.get_json()
    conn = get_db()
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    
    try:
        cursor.execute("""
            SELECT 
                deptno as "id",
                deptname as "name",
                location as "location",
                mgrno as "manager"
            FROM sample.department
            WHERE deptno = ?
        """, (id,))
        department = cursor.fetchone()

        if department:
            cursor.execute(
                """
                UPDATE sample.department 
                SET deptname = ?, location = ?, mgrno = ? 
                WHERE deptno = ?
                """,
                (data['name'], data['location'], data['manager'], id)
            )
            conn.commit()

            updated_department = {
                "id": id,
                "name": data['name'],
                "location": data['location'],
                "manager": data['manager']
            }
            return jsonify(updated_department)
        else:
            return jsonify({"error": "Department not found"}), 404
    finally:
        cursor.close()
        conn.close()
```
</Card>

## Consuming an API

<Card>
To consume an API, you can use the popular `requests` library in Python. Install it using:
```shell
pip3 install requests
```
</Card>

<Card>
### GET /employees
First, create a new file `consume.py` and add the following code to retrieve the list of employees:
```python
// consume.py

import requests

# Get the list of employees
response = requests.get('http://localhost:5000/employees')
if response.status_code == 200:
    employees = response.json()
    print("Employees:", employees)
else:
    print("Failed to retrieve employees:", response.status_code)
```

This script sends a GET request to the `/employees` endpoint and prints the list of employees if the request is successful.

</Card>
<Aside type="note">
You can either run your original `host.py` script or try out the hosted API Playground to test this script out `http://magic.magic-ug.org:10500/` with the `/employees` endpoint and `/departments` endpoint.
</Aside>

<Card>
### PUT /employees
Next, add code to `consume.py` to add your own employee details using a PUT request:
```python
// consume.py

# Define the new employee data
new_employee = {
    "first": "John",
    "last": "Doe",
    "job": "Software Developer",
    "workdept": "IT",
    "salary": 100000
}

# Send the PUT request to add the new employee
response = requests.put('http://localhost:5000/employees', json=new_employee)
if response.status_code == 200:
    created_employee = response.json()
    print("Employee added successfully. Your new Employee ID is:", created_employee['id'])
else:
    print("Failed to add employee:", response.status_code)
```

This script sends a PUT request to the `/employees` endpoint with the new employee data and prints the ID of the newly created employee if the request is successful.

</Card>

## GET & PATCH /departments

<Card>
To retrieve the list of departments and update the manager for departments where the manager is '101', follow these steps:

### GET /departments then PATCH /departments
```python 
// consume.py

# Get the list of departments
response = requests.get('http://localhost:5000/departments')
if response.status_code == 200:
    departments = response.json()
    print("Departments:", departments)
else:
    print("Failed to retrieve departments:", response.status_code)

# Update departments where the manager is '101'
for department in departments:
    if department['manager'] == '101':
        department['manager'] = '121'
        patch_response = requests.patch(f"http://localhost:5000/departments/{department['id']}", json=department)
        if patch_response.status_code == 200:
            print(f"Updated department {department['id']} successfully.")
        else:
            print(f"Failed to update department {department['id']}: {patch_response.status_code}")
```

This script demonstrates taking the results of one API to feed another subsequent API call.

In this fictional scenario, we're updating the manager for departments where the manager is '101' to '121' without knowing the department IDs in advance.

</Card>

## Basics of Authentication

<Card>
### Common Types
- **Basic Authentication**: This method involves sending the username and password encoded in Base64 in the `Authorization` header.
- **Bearer Token**: This method uses a token that is generated by the server and sent in the `Authorization` header. The token is usually a JWT (JSON Web Token).
- **API Key**: This method involves sending a unique key, usually in the query parameters or headers, to authenticate requests.
</Card>

<Card>
### Testing Auth Tokens
To test Auth Tokens add the `Authorization` header to your requests. 

If your client supports it, there might be a dedicated tab for Auth. Refer to the screenshot for using a bearer token in Thunder Client.

![Thunder Client Auth Token](/api_workshop/thunder-client-auth-token.png)
</Card>

<Card>
### Sending a Bearer Token in your GET request to /employees
To send a bearer token in your GET request to /employees, you need to include the Authorization header with the token when calling requests. 

```python 
// consume.py

import requests

# Define the bearer token
token = 'your_token_here'

# Set the headers with the Authorization token
headers = { 'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}' }

# Get the list of employees
response = requests.get('http://localhost:5000/employees', headers=headers)
if response.status_code == 200:
    employees = response.json()
    print("Employees:", employees)
else:
    print("Failed to retrieve employees:", response.status_code)
```
Replace 'your_token_here' with your actual bearer token. This script sends a GET request to the /employees endpoint with the bearer token included in the Authorization header.
</Card>

<Aside type="danger">
Don't actually hard code your authentication tokens in your code. Use environment variables or a secure database to store and retrieve them. This is just for demonstration purposes.
</Aside>
