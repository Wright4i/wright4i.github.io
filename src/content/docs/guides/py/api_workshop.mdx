## Recommendations

You must **B**ring **Y**our **O**wn **D**evice and have access to an IBM i.

While you can simply copy the code, it is recommended to follow along and type it out yourself to get a better understanding of the concepts.

## Goals
* Understand APIs & Documentation <Icon name="approve-check-circle" class="icon-inline color-jade" />

* Have Fun <Icon name="approve-check-circle" class="icon-inline color-jade" />

## RESTful API Basics
REST (Representational State Transfer) is a way to design networked applications. It uses HTTP requests to perform operations like Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) on resources identified by URLs.

Key principles of REST:
- **Stateless**: Each request from client to server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.
- **Client-Server**: The client and server are independent and can be developed separately.
- **Cacheable**: Responses must define themselves as cacheable or not to prevent clients from reusing stale or inappropriate data.
- **Uniform Interface**: Resources are identified in the request, and the operations are defined by HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).

In summary, RESTful APIs provide a standardized way for systems to communicate over HTTP using a set of well-defined operations and principles.

### Methods
<CardGrid>
<Card title="GET" icon="list-format">
The GET method retrieves data from the server.
</Card>
<Card title="PUT" icon="add-document">
The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
</Card>
<Card title="PATCH" icon="pen">
The PATCH method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.
</Card>
<Card title="POST" icon="document">
The POST method is used update an existing resource or create a new resource.
</Card>
<Card title="DELETE" icon="bitbucket">
The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.
</Card>
<Card title="HEAD/OPTIONS/TRACE/CONNECT" icon="puzzle">
Less commonly used methods for various purposes like checking the server status, options available, tracing the request, and establishing a tunnel.
</Card>
</CardGrid>

### Status Codes
<CardGrid>
<Card title="200 OK" icon="approve-check">
The request has succeeded.
</Card>
<Card title="201 Created" icon="approve-check">
The request has been fulfilled and has resulted in one or more new resources being created.
</Card>
<Card title="400 Bad Request" icon="close">
The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client close.
</Card>
<Card title="401 Unauthorized" icon="close">
Similar to 403 Forbidden, but specifically for use when authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided.
</Card>
<Card title="404 Not Found" icon="close">
The requested resource could not be found but may be available in the future.
</Card>
<Card title="500 Internal Server Error" icon="error">
A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific message is suitable.
</Card>
</CardGrid>

## Setting up your Environment

<Card>
    ### Installing Python
    <Aside type="caution">
    Before you start, make sure you only have a single version of Python installed.

    If you are unsure goto the terminal and run:
    ```shell title="VSCode Terminal"
    python --version
    ```

    If you see `Python 2.x.x` try adding a `3` to the end of the command:
    ```shell title="VSCode Terminal"
    python3 --version
    ```

    Mapepire requires **Python 3.10** or newer to run. If your version is older, you will need to update it.

    **Note**: Certain versions of Windows `python` and `python3` might open the Microsoft Store. If that happens, press `GET` and install Python 3 from the store.
    </Aside>

    Installing Python is straightforward. You can download the latest version from the official Python website.

    When you first install Python, **make sure to check the box that says** `[✓] Add Python to PATH`!

    </Card>
</CardGrid>
<Aside type="caution">
In this guide, we use `python3` and `pip3` commands.

Not every system will be the same. Sometimes `python` and `pip` are used instead (if they resolve to Python 3).

Adjust the commands in this guide as needed for your system.
</Aside>

### Project Setup
<CardGrid stagger>
<Card title="Step #1" icon="add-document">
Create a new folder for your project. This can be a folder anywhere on your computer.
</Card>

<Card title="Step #2" icon="open-book">
Open Visual Studio Code and select `FILE` and "Open Folder" to open your project folder.
</Card>

<Card title="Step #3" icon="forward-slash">
Open the terminal (`` Ctrl + ` `` in VS Code).
</Card>

<Card title="Step #4" icon="laptop">
Create a new virtual environment: 
```shell title="VSCode Terminal"
python3 -m venv --system-site-packages venv
```
<Aside type="note">
Virtual environments are used to manage dependencies for your projects. All your `PIP` installs will be isolated to this environment.
</Aside>
</Card>

<Card title="Step #5" icon="rocket">
Activate your virtual environment:
    - On Windows (powershell):
        ```shell title="VSCode Terminal"
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS/Linux or Windows (bash):
        ```shell title="VSCode Terminal"
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    - On PASE (IBM i):
        ```shell title="VSCode Terminal"
        . venv/bin/activate
        ```
<Aside type="note">
If you see `(venv)` in your terminal prompt, you have successfully activated your virtual environment.

You will need to activate your virtual environment every time you open a new terminal.

In VS Code, the lower right corner should say `Python 3.x.x (venv)` you can click on this to change versions and virtual environments.
</Aside>
</Card>
</CardGrid>

## Setting up a Basic Flask Application

<Card>
### Step 1: Use the python package manager `pip` to install Flask
```shell title="VSCode Terminal"
pip3 install flask
```
</Card>

<Card>
### Step 2: Create a new file `hello.py`

<Aside type="tip">
Your directory structure should look like this:
```
project-folder/
├── venv/
|  └── ...
└── hello.py
```
</Aside>
```python
// hello.py

from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return 'Hello, World!'

# ^^ Add New Routes Above ^^
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, port=5000)
```

We start by importing the Flask module and creating a new instance of the Flask class. We then define a route for the root URL `/` that returns the string "Hello, World!".

<Aside type="note">
```python 
if __name__ == '__main__':
```
This construct is a common Python idiom that allows you to control the execution of code based on whether the script is run directly or imported as a module. 
</Aside>
</Card>

<Card>
### Step 2: Run your Flask app
```shell title="VSCode Terminal"
python3 hello.py
```
</Card>

<Card>
### Step 3: Open your browser
Navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000). You should see "Hello, World!".

<Aside type="tip">
GET endpoints can be tested directly in your browser! 
For other methods like POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE, you can use tools like Thunder Client or Postman.
</Aside>
</Card>

## Setting up the Database Connection

<Card>
### Step 1: Install additional packages
```shell title="VSCode Terminal"
pip3 install mapepire-python
```
</Card>

<Card>
### Step 2: Create a new file `mapepire.ini` updating `SERVERNAME`, `USERNAME`, `PASSWORD`
```ini
// mapepire.ini

[mapepire]
SERVER=SERVERNAME
PORT=10500
USER=USERNAME
PASSWORD=PASSWORD
```

The default port if you setup mapepire server on your IBM i is `8076`.

<Aside type="tip">
Your directory structure should now look like this:
```
project-folder/
├── venv/
|  └── ...
├── hello.py
└── mapepire.ini
```
</Aside>
</Card>

<Card>
### Step 3: Copy this to a new file `db.py` 
Creating a new file `db.py` to handle the database connection will help keep your code organized and keep us from repeating the same code in multiple places.

<Aside type="tip">
Hover over the top-right corner of code blocks for a clipboard button <Icon name="right-arrow" class="icon-inline color-amethyst-high" />
</Aside>
```python
// db.py

import configparser
from mapepire_python import connect
from mapepire_python.data_types import DaemonServer

def get_db():
    config = configparser.ConfigParser()
    config.read('mapepire.ini')

    creds = DaemonServer(
        host=config['mapepire']['SERVER'],
        port=config['mapepire']['PORT'],
        user=config['mapepire']['USER'],
        password=config['mapepire']['PASSWORD'],
        ignoreUnauthorized=True
    )

    return connect(creds)
```
</Card>

## Creating API Endpoints

<Card>
### GET /employees
Create a new program `host.py`

Here's an example of a simple API that returns a list of employees from the `SAMPLE.EMPLOYEE` table:

```python
// host.py

import os
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
from db import get_db

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/employees', methods=['GET'])
def get_employees():
    with get_db() as conn:
        with conn.execute("""
            select
                empno as "id",
                firstnme as "first",
                lastname as "last",
                job as "job",
                workdept as "workdept",
                salary as "salary"
            from sample.employee
        """) as cursor:
            rows = cursor.fetchall()
       
            return rows['data']

# ^^ Add New Routes Above ^^

                job as "job",
                workdept as "workdept",
                salary as "salary"
            from sample.employee
            where empno = ?
        """, (id,)) as cursor:
            employee = cursor.fetchone()

            if employee['data']:
                return employee['data']

## Testing your API
Before we move onto other REST methods, let's cover how to test your API with tools that are available to you.

<CardGrid>
<Card>
### Thunder Client
Use the extension in VS Code to test your API endpoints. 
* Create a `New Request` and 
* Specify the Method (GET/PUT/PATCH) and URL (ex. `http://127.0.0.1:5000/employees`)
* Add any headers or body data.
* Click `Send Request` to see the response.
</Card>
<Card>

</Card>
</CardGrid>

<Card>
### PATCH /departments/`{id}`
Add the following route to `host.py` to update the manager for a specific department by its ID using a PATCH request:
```python
// host.py

@app.route('/departments/<id>', methods=['PATCH'])
def update_department(id):
    payload = request.get_json()
    with get_db() as conn:
        with conn.execute("""
            SELECT 
                deptno as "id",
                deptname as "name",
                location as "location",
                mgrno as "manager"
            FROM sample.department
            WHERE deptno = ?
        """, (id,)) as cursor:
            department = cursor.fetchone()

            if department['data']:
                conn.execute(
                    """
                    UPDATE sample.department 
                    SET deptname = ?, location = ?, mgrno = ? 
                    WHERE deptno = ?
                    """,
                    (payload['name'], payload['location'], payload['manager'], id)
                )

                updated_department = {
                    "id": id,
                    "name": payload['name'],
                    "location": payload['location'],
                    "manager": payload['manager']
                }
                return jsonify(updated_department)
            else:
                return jsonify({"error": "Department not found"}), 404
```

#### Test this endpoint using Thunder Client!

Select `PATCH` and enter `http://127.0.0.1:5000/departments/A00` with the following JSON data in the `Request Body`:

```json
{
    "name": "New Department Name",
    "location": "New Location",
    "manager": "000020"
}
```

<Aside type="caution">
`manager` is limited to 6 characters and must be a valid employee number from the `EMPLOYEE` table.
</Aside>

Then switch to `GET` to verify the changes.
</Card>

## Consuming an API

<Card>
To consume an API, you can use the popular `requests` library in Python. Install it using:
```shell title="VSCode Terminal"
pip3 install requests
```
</Card>

<Card>
### GET /employees
First, create a new file `consume.py` and add the following code to retrieve the list of employees:
```python
// consume.py

import requests

# Get the list of employees from our host API
response = requests.get('http://127.0.0.1:5000/employees')
if response.status_code == 200: # Check if the request was successful
    employees = response.json() # Convert the response to JSON
    print("Employees:", employees)
else: # Error handling
    print("Failed to retrieve employees:", response.status_code)
    print(response.text)

```

This script sends a GET request to the `/employees` endpoint and prints the list of employees if the request is successful.

</Card>

<Card>
### Testing `consume.py`
    <Aside type="danger">
        Before testing `consume.py` your original `host.py` script should be running. 

        Press the `+` to open a new terminal in VS Code.
    </Aside>

```shell title="VSCode Terminal"
python3 consume.py
```
</Card>

<Card>
### PATCH /departments
Next, add code to `consume.py` to patch departments with data from the `/departments` endpoint:
```python
// consume.py

# Send the GET request to retrieve all departments
response = requests.get('http://127.0.0.1:5000/departments')
if response.status_code == 200:
    departments = response.json() # Convert the response to JSON
    
    for department in departments: # Loop through each department
        department_id = department['id']

        # Update the department's location to "Costa Mesa"
        updated_department = { 
            "name": department['name'],
            "manager": department['manager'],
            "location": "Costa Mesa"
        }
        
        # Send the PATCH request to update the department's location passing in department_id and updated_department
        patch_response = requests.patch(f'http://127.0.0.1:5000/departments/{department_id}', json=updated_department)
        if patch_response.status_code == 200: 
            print(f"Department {department_id} location updated successfully.")
        else:
            print(f"Failed to update department {department_id}:", patch_response.status_code)
            print(patch_response.text)
else:
    print("Failed to retrieve departments:", response.status_code)
    print(response.text)
```

This script sends a PATCH request to the `/departments` endpoint with the new location data and prints the ID of the updated departments if the request is successful.

</Card>

<Card>
### Test `consume.py` again
    `host.py` script should be running. Call `python3 consume.py` to test the script.

    The code should GET the list of Departments, PATCH the location to "Costa Mesa" and print that it updated departments.

    Verify Location was updated by calling `GET` on the `/departments` endpoint.

```shell title="VSCode Terminal"
python3 consume.py
```
</Card>

# Congratulations! 🎉 

You've successfully set up a basic Flask application, created API endpoints and consumed those APIs all using Python.

This is for you! <Icon name="star" class="icon-inline color-topaz" />

Take a moment to reflect on what you've learned and how you can apply this knowledge to your own projects.

## Side Quests

Take a look at the API endpoints available in the API Playground and try to consume them using Python.

### Explore the API Endpoints using Swagger
Swagger UI is a popular tool for visualizing APIs. It provides a user-friendly interface to interact with APIs and understand their endpoints and data structures.

If an API has an OpenAPI formatted yml or json file, you can use Swagger UI to visualize it.

<LinkCard title="View API Playground's API" href="https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Wright4i/06184a609ee80090466fe2c8a6f0c468/raw/9d0601690232250713300bb7eec6ae7dbd07f2ef/playground.yml" description="editor.swagger.io" />

### Get Authenticated
Many APIs require authentication to access their endpoints. There are several methods for authenticating requests to APIs.

<Card>
#### Common Types
- **Basic Authentication**: This method involves sending the username and password encoded in Base64 in the `Authorization` header.
- **Bearer Token**: This method uses a token that is generated by the server and sent in the `Authorization` header. The token is usually a JWT (JSON Web Token).
- **API Key**: This method involves sending a unique key, usually in the query parameters or headers, to authenticate requests.
</Card>

<Card>
#### Generate a Auth Token with API Playground
![API Playground Valid Token](/api_workshop/api-playground-generate-token.png)

### Testing Auth Tokens
To test Auth Tokens add the `Authorization` header to your requests. 

If your client supports it, there might be a dedicated tab for Auth. Refer to the screenshot for using a bearer token in Thunder Client.

![Thunder Client Auth Token](/api_workshop/thunder-client-auth-token.png)
</Card>

<Card>
### Sending a Bearer Token in your GET request to /employees
To send a bearer token in your GET request to /employees, you need to include the Authorization header with the token when calling requests. 

```python 
// consume.py

import requests

# Define the bearer token
token = 'your_token_here'

# Set the headers with the Authorization token
headers = { 'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}' }

# Get the list of employees
response = requests.get('http://127.0.0.1:5000/employees', headers=headers)
if response.status_code == 200:
    employees = response.json()
    print("Employees:", employees)
else:
    print("Failed to retrieve employees:", response.status_code)
```
Replace 'your_token_here' with your actual bearer token. This script sends a GET request to the /employees endpoint with the bearer token included in the Authorization header.

Don't actually hard code your authentication tokens in your code. Use environment variables or a secure database to store and retrieve them. This is just for demonstration purposes.
