## Hi, I'm Joseph Wright! üëã

At the heart of Southern California's vibrant tech scene, I navigate the world of programming with a passion. I'm a {new Date().getFullYear() - 1992}-year-old programmer and entrepreneur, steering Wright 400 Inc, an IBM i software consulting company. 

My toolkit? A robust blend of RPG <IconIBM class="icon-inline" />, SQL <IconDB2 class="icon-inline" />, Node <IconNodeJS class="icon-inline" />, and Python <IconPython class="icon-inline" />.

### Journey Through Code <IconCode class="icon-inline" />

My path is defined by learning, leadership, and a dedication to community:

### Vice Presidency at OCEAN üåä

I am proud to be a part of the OCEAN User Group, a community of IBM i professionals in Southern California. I am currently serving as the Vice President of Membership, a role that allows me to contribute to the community in a new way. I am excited to be a part of the Board of Directors and look forward to making a positive impact on the community this year and beyond. I hope to be able to grow our membership and bring new and exciting ideas to the table.

### Core Team Member at Code4i  <IconCake class="icon-inline" />Ô∏è

<div class="grid-2">
  <div class="grid item">
    Code4i is a community-driven initiative that aims to bring modern development tools and practices to the IBM i platform. I am proud to be a part of the core team, working alongside talented individuals Liam, Christian, and S√©bastien; **true IBM Champions**.

    The flagship extension, Code for IBM i, turned 3 years old in 2024! I am beyond impressed with how far we've come. Featured both in the IBM i community and officially recognized by IBM with their full support. We are committed to making the IBM i platform more accessible to developers and are always looking for new contributors to join our project.

    Visual Studio Code is an IDE that's popular with developers across the globe. Adding support for the IBM i through these extensions is a game-changer for how we development on the platform. This bridges the divide between new developers and the IBM i, making it easier for them to get started and be productive. It also provides a modern development experience to seasoned IBM i developers at no cost.

### Future Endeavors <IconRocket class="icon-inline" />

The future is bright and full of ambitious goals. I will continue to write about my experiences and share my knowledge with the community. 
Speaking at and organizing Conferences will be an integral part of my mission as well as continuing to contribute to open-source projects. 

I am always open to new opportunities and ideas. We can achieve great things together and shape the future of the IBM i by advocating for this great platform. The IBM i runs the world and it's time to show what it can do.
